# links

Going for a barebones link manager.

Done in two hours, hopefully I never have to touch the code again.

Links stored as json.

Compiles a basic html page which displays the list, with accessory pages for tags.

| File | Desc. |
| ---- | ---- |
|input.js | Create new link (`-c` argument to compile after insertion). |
|compile.js | Compiles the pages. |
|parse.js | Bulk import markdown links found in `input.md`. |
|config.js | Config. |
